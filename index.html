    <b><EM>BASICS OF THE WEB</em></b><br><br>
Some of the most important concepts that we will find when talking about the web are:
<p>WWW, which stands for World Wide Web and is formed by a collection of HTML documents<br>
  HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language  and represents the main document type of the web<br>
  URL's which stands for Uniform Resource Locator<br>
  HTTP which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and represents webÂ´s main protocol.<br>
  Web applications, the purpose of this course.<br>

<b>HTML</b><br><br>
HTML is made up of text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), references to other documents (eg images or videos) and links to other pages.<br>
<br>
<b>Markup</b><br><br>
In order to give format to the text in HTML (Markup) we instruct computer using TAGS. Keep in mind that sometimes we refer to computers as "stupid", because they follow instructions exactly as we give them. This
gives us a great amount of power, while at the same time we have to be very careful with detail.<br>
<br>
<b>BASIC STRUCTURE</b><br><br>
< "NAME" > CONTENT < /"NAME" ><br><br>
 OPENING TAG-----------CLOSING TAG <br><br>
The basic structure formed by <big>opening tag, content</big> and <big>closing tag</big> is called <big>element.</big> 
<br><br>
Since there are lots of different tags, it would be very difficult to memorize them all. It is always easier to google them
the moment you need it.
<br><br>
A good thing to remember though, is that there are some elements that do not require the use of closing tag, which are called <big>void tags</big>(eg. < br >, < img >)
<br><br>
<b>Inline vs block tags</b>
<br><br>
Just as the name implies, <em>inline tags</em> keep all the text in a single line, while <em>block tags</em> create kind of an invisible box around the text.
<br><br>
< br >, < b >, < em >, < span > and < img > tags are all examples of inline tags, while < p > and < div > tags are both block ones.
